# CNNVis: Visualizing CNNs
Welcome to CNNVis. CNNVis is a high-level convolutional neural network (CNN) visualization API, built onto of Keras. The intention behind this project aligns with that of Keras: "Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible daly is key to doing good research".

Use CNNVis if you need to visualize the following aspects of a CNN:
* Kernels / filters
* Activations of a specific layer / kernel to specific images
* The 2D pattern that maximally activates a kernel
* Saliency maps
