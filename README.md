# CNNVis: Visualizing CNNs
Welcome to CNNVis! CNNVis is a high-level convolutional neural network (CNN) visualization API built on top of Keras. The intention behind this project aligns with the intention of Keras: "Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible daly is key to doing good research". 

Use CNNVis if you need to visualize the following aspects of a CNN:
* Kernels / filters
* Activations of a specific layer / kernel to specific images
* The 2D pattern that maximally activates a kernel
* Saliency maps
* (Email yangz2@carleton.edu about anything you would like to visualize!)

The main resource that tremendously helped the development of this project is:
* The official Keras documentation: https://keras.io/
* Chapter 5: Computer Vision of _Deep Learning with Python_ by Francis Chollet



## Getting Started: 30 seconds to CNNVis

The `Visualizer` class is the only class defined in this library. 

To instantiate a `Visualizer`,
